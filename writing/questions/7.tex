\section*{Q7}
We decided to implement the Minimum Error Training Rate algorithm for choosing optimal model parameter values, described in \cite{och2003}. While with only 3 (or 4, counting translation length) features tuning the weights by hand is feasible, in principle the number of features could be much larger. Since we want to set the model weights so that the best translations achieve the highest model scores, we need a criterion for goodness of translation, aka an error function. In essence we want to tune the weights so that highest scoring translations contain the least errors as compared to reference. We chose the use BLEU as the error function. We apply the METR implementation to learn the optimal parameters on the training data, and supply these parameters to the standard reranker for use on the test data.
