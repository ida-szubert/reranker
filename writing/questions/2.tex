\section*{Q2}

Subjectively, the translations chosen with reversed language model weight are not obviously worse, or even less fluent. They do, however seem to be longer. Since the longer the sentence the smaller the language model probability it is to be expected that minimizing this feature value will favour longer outputs. For instance, the following two translations arguably do not differ in content, although the second uses 10 words for what the first expresses in 3: \textit{"' cold and inhuman ' : anders беринг breivik first publicly trial"}, \textit{"' cold and inhuman ' : anders fogh беринг breivik publicly appears before by the court for the first time"}.

It seems that sometimes the preference for shortness leads to loss of information, e.g. compare the outputs of the default \textit{"after the summer the researchers wanted to learn more about these people ."} and LM-flipped \textit{"after summer of the tragedy the researchers want to learn more about the these people ."} rerankers. Both of these sentences are good English, and the second one is closer to the reference translation which includes the phrase \textit{"this summer's tragedy"}. In this example by reversing the LM likelihood weight we actually choose a better candidate. That information can be left out is evident from comparison of the default  \textit{"someone can use the ' language ' when answering a question : " well ... the truth ... how do i know ... as far as i know . "} and LM-flipped \textit{"somebody can use the ' qualification language ' , when responds to a difficult question : " well ... the truth ... as far as i know ... as far as i know . "}. The former simply does not include translations of the adjectives modifying \tetxit{language} and \textit{question}.

There are examples of LM likelihood value actually tracking what we'd like it to track, namely English fluency and idiomaticity. The default reranker chooses \textit{"you need to keep in mind 5,000 these concepts , ideas - them all together ."] over the LM-flipped output of \textit{"you need to keep in the head of the 5,000 of ideas - these concepts , ' combining them all together ... '"}, thus exhibiting preference for the correct expression \textit{keep in mind}. Similarily, the phrase \textit{the health care law} sounds more natural than \textit{the law about the health care}

In some cases reversing the bias for language model probability leads to choosing more comprehensible translations, e.g. the default \textit{"' this paper tiger , the army barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , to accomplish the mission , ' panetta said in his introductory remarks at the pentagon ."} as compared to LM-flipped \textit{"' it 's a paper tiger , the army with the barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers , who can accomplish the mission , ' panetta said in their introductory remarks in the pentagon ."}.
