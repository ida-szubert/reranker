\section*{Q1}

We are using argmax over the sum of weighted features, so changing the sign on one weight means looking for the maximum of its inverse. We select $\hat{e}$ which effectively maximizes two of the features and minimizes one. In this case minimizing p(e) means favouring least fluent English sentences. In principle we can expect the quality of the top translation to decrease. However, the effect depends on considerations such as how good the language model is or how big the variation in p(e) is between the top 100 decoder outputs.
