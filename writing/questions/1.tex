\section*{Q1}

Since we are using argmax over the sum of weighted features to find the best translation, changing the sign on one feature weight means that we are looking for the maximum of its inverse. Instead of selecting \hat{e} such that maximizes a linear combination of feature values, we select one which effectively maximizes two of the features and minimizes one. If the weight of language model log likelihood is set to -1, we instruct the reranker to favour the least fluent, rather than the most, English sentences. In principle we can expect the quality of the top translation to decrease. However, the magnitude of the effect depends on considerations such as how good the language model is or how big the variation in p(e) is between the top 100 decoder outputs.
