\section*{Q1}


Since we are using argmax over the sum of weighted features to find the best translation, changing the sign on one feature weight means that we are looking for its minimum, rather than maximum, value. If the weight of language model log likelihood is set to -1, we can expect the chosen translation to not be a particularly fluent English sentence.
