\section*{Q5}

Our implementation of local reordering does not involve any changes to the
hypotheses objects. We modify the translation model by inserting an empty
phrase which translates to English as an empty string with probability 1.

We introduce a modification in the hypothesis extension step. Given a
hypothesis which ends at index \textit{i} in the French sentence we consider
all indices \textit{c} and \textit{j} such that $c \leq j$, $j \leq
|sentence|$, and the fragments of the sentence delimited by \textit{[i, c]}
and \textit{[c, j]} are phrases. Since we allow for $c = j$, the second
phrase may be the empty one we have added to the translation model. For each
discovered pair of phrases we create a hypothesis by swapping them and
considering $k$ best translations for each. For a pair with an empty phrase
this amounts to no reordering.
