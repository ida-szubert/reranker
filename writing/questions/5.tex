\section*{Q5}

A grid search through all the three features (with weights between -5 and 5) was carried out. The highest BLEU score (28.16, 0.81 higher than default) was achieved with the following configuration of feature weights:

\centerline{p(e) : 2,    p(e$|$f) : 3,    p\_lex(f$|$e) : 5}

Qualitatively, the translations chosen with the optimal parameter configuration are generally of better fluency and accuracy. They are also more verbose, which is a good thing, given the tendency of the default model to favour too short sentences. Limiting the relative weight of the p(e) lets the intended Russian meaning to be preserved. This is seen in the first example in section \textit{Best parameters} in table~\ref{translation_compare}, where the default reranker drops the adverb \textit{latest}.

The second example shows how a more precise translation is created as a more fluent syntax is produced by allowing larger but less frequent clause types.
   
In many cases default and optimal reranker output differ in one choice between synonymous words or phrases. Sometimes the default reranker picks a better synonym, as in the final example in table~\ref{translation_compare}. Potentially the heavy weighting of p(e$|$f) and p\_lex(f$|$e) encourages a closer match to original Russian, at a cost of choosing a word less appropriate in the English context.
