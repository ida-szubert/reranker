\section*{Q3}
For each French sentence of length $n$, we loop over all $n$ possible stacks. In each stack, we look at the top $s$ hypotheses and expand them. To perform an expansion we choose two consecutive phrases (the second of which might be $\varepsilon$), swap them, and consider all possible combinations of the first $k$ translations of each phrase. The maximum considered length of phrase is $n$. Finally, the algorithm calculates the language model probability of the generated two-phrase translation. In this step, the algorithm has to iterate over up to $2 t$ words, where $t$ is the maximum length of a translation phrase. Thus the overall complexity is as follows:

\[
\mathcal{O}(n \cdot s) \cdot \mathcal{O}({(n \cdot k)}^2)
\cdot \mathcal{O}(t)
= \mathcal{O}(n^3 \cdot k^2 \cdot s \cdot t)
\]
