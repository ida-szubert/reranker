\section*{Q4}

In comparison to the default reranker, the oracle translations tend to have better BLEU scores. The oracle outputs are intuitively better, but there are still types of Russian constructions which are not dealt with well. Let's look at the first example in table~\ref{translation_compare}.
  
The oracle translation is more precise and accounts for the English distinction between \textit{house} and \textit{home} by choosing the phrase \textit{residents of the house}, rather than \textit{home}. However, the preferred preposition of \textit{the stairwell} was correctly chosen by the default reranker and not by the oracle.
Similarly in the second and third example, the oracle provides a more fluent translation, being able to create a fully formed sentence made up of complex clause types - relatively rare or infrequent syntax.

However, aside from these particular improvements, there are many sentences that are still not good translations. These occur particularly with sentences with rare special characters, as in \textit{"including an option to buy 20 more planes , total volume , in fact , the \$ 26 billion ."}.

Further, Russian conventions for comparative constructions are retained in the translation, resulting in poorly-formed English sentences, e.g.  \textit{"but residents complaining of the dirt and noise , in many communities is becoming more and more ."}

Similarly, longer and more complex multi-clausal sentences tend to be problematic: \textit{"all four birds used the wire to make and used hooks hooks , to a bucket for pen and pull him out of the cylinder"}

Since the oracle chooses translations out of the 100 provided candidates so that the BLUE score for the whole set is maximized, the shortcomings of oracle's outputs likely reflect the shortcomings of the decoder, translation models, and language model used to produce the translations. For instance, no good translation ca be found among the top 100 for the sentence describing the \$26 billion plane-buying event.
Alternatively, we might interpret the badness of the chosen translations as indicating that the BLUE metric is not that well aligned with actual translation quality. An illustration of this point is offered by example four in table~\ref{translation_compare}. Even though the choice of the default reranker is clearly better, its BLUE score is lower.

To decide how much blame to ascribe to each explanation we can subjectively pick the best candidate translations and see in how many cases does the oracle agree with our choice.
