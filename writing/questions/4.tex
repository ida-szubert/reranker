\section*{Q4}

In our implementation, the mapping from hypotheses to stacks is the same in
the decoder with local reordering as it was in the one without. Each
hypothesis is placed on a stack corresponding to the index of the last French
word being translated. We do not create hypotheses in which French phrases
are skipped, but instead always look at two consecutive phrases, swap them,
and create a hypothesis which covers both phrases. This means that mapping
onto stacks is straightforward, since the number of French words covered by
a hypothesis is always the same as the index of the last word which it
translates. In short, the hypotheses we generate do not have gaps
in coverage of the source sentence and can be simply placed on the stack
corresponding to the last word covered.
