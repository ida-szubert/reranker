For each French sentence of length $n$, we loop over all $n$ possible
stacks. In each stack, we look at the top $s$ hypotheses and expand them.
In each expansion, the algorithm contemplates all possible combinations of
the first $k$ translations of two French phrases, where it explores phrase
lengths of no more than $n$. Finally, the algorithm calculates the language
model probability of this combination. In this step, the algorithm has to
iterate over up to $2 t$ words, where $t$ is the maximum length of a
translation phrase. Thus the overall complexity is as follows:

\[
    \mathcal{O}(n \cdot s) \cdot \mathcal{O}({(n \cdot k)}^2)
    \cdot \mathcal{O}(t)
    = \mathcal{O}(n^3 \cdot k^2 \cdot s \cdot t)
\]
